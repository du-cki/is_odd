# Is Odd

A blazingly fast asynchronous and intelligent API running on the edge, written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) to tell you if a provided integer is odd, or not!

This is currently running [here](https://is_odd.du-cki.workers.dev/12).

A typical API response will be the following format:

```json
{
    "is_odd": false,
    "number": 12
}
```


This entire repository and it's usage is satirical.
