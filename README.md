# Is Odd

A small, asynchronous and intelligent API to tell you if a provided integer is odd, or not!

This is currently running [here](https://is-oddd.herokuapp.com/12).

A typical API response will be the following format:

```json
{
    "number": 12,
    "is_odd": false
}
```


This entire repository and it's usage is satirical.
